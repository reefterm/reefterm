# Reef Terminal Resources

Application resources bundled into the packaged app (icons and similar assets).

Everything in this folder is copied verbatim into the installer via
`extraResources`, so do not leave build artifacts here.

The one exception is `hello-helper.exe`, which `npm run build:hello` compiles
and which only the Windows package carries. It is filtered out of the macOS and
Linux builds, and it is gitignored, so it is absent from a fresh checkout until
you build it.

## Icons

The app icon is not here. It lives at `build/icon.png` in the repo root, and
all three platform targets point at that one file: electron-builder generates
the Windows `.ico` and the macOS `.icns` from it, and Linux takes the PNG as
it is.

`win.icon` used to name `resources/icon.ico`, which was never committed, so
every Windows build up to now quietly shipped the default Electron logo.
electron-builder warns about a missing icon rather than failing, which is how
that went unnoticed.

**Placeholder, inherited from the CloudTerm fork this repo started from, pending
Reef Terminal's own artwork.** The current `build/icon.png` is built from
`cloudterm.png` in the repo root, which is 200x200 and so below the minimum
every target needs (256 for Linux and the Windows ico, 512 for the macOS icns).

The upscale is not a plain resample. `cloudterm.png` measures as a square flush
to its canvas with a corner radius of exactly 30% of the side (a circle fits to
0.08px rms) over a flat `#11121A`, so the frame is redrawn analytically at
1024 from that geometry and only the cloud is resampled. That keeps the
silhouette a one-pixel edge instead of feathering it over five, which is the
part of an icon the eye reads first. The cloud itself is still a 5.12x
interpolation and is soft if you go looking at full size, though it is
invisible by the time anything downscales it to a taskbar.

Replacing this with a real 1024x1024 export is still worth doing the next time
the source art is to hand. Dropping that in at the same path is the whole job:
no configuration changes with it.
