/**
 * Writes the three files winget wants in order to describe one release.
 *
 * A winget package is not a build artifact. It is a directory of YAML inside
 * microsoft/winget-pkgs saying where an installer lives and what its hash is,
 * and it gets there by pull request. Every release after the first opens that
 * pull request on its own, from the `winget` job in release.yml, which copies
 * the previous version's manifest forward and changes the version, the URL and
 * the hash. The first release has nothing to copy from, so this writes it.
 *
 *     node scripts/winget-manifest.js [tag]
 *
 * The tag defaults to `v` followed by the version in package.json. The files
 * land in dist/winget/, in the same directory layout winget-pkgs uses, so the
 * whole version directory can be copied into a fork of it unchanged.
 *
 * Nothing below is typed in twice. The installer URL, its SHA256 and the
 * release date all come from the GitHub release itself, so this cannot
 * describe a build that was never published, and the ProductCode is derived
 * the way electron-builder derives it rather than pasted from a machine that
 * happened to have the app installed.
 *
 * docs/winget.md is the surrounding process: what to do with the output, and
 * the one-time setup that lets later releases skip this script entirely.
