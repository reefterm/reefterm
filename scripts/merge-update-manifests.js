/**
 * Folds the per-arch update manifests into the one file the updater reads.
 *
 * electron-builder writes a `latest-mac.yml` beside whatever it just built, and
 * the release workflow builds the two macOS architectures on two runners,
 * because each has to carry a different Claude binary. So two manifests arrive,
 * each describing only its own half of the release, and one release can only
 * publish one of them.
 *
 * Letting the second overwrite the first is the bug this exists to prevent, and
 * it is a quiet one. electron-updater picks from the file list by looking for
 * `process.arch` in the name and falls back to the first entry when nothing
 * matches, so a manifest listing only `ReefTerminal-arm64.zip` does not fail on an
 * Intel Mac. It hands over the arm64 build, and the failure surfaces later as
 * an app that will not start.
 *
 * Merging is a list splice and not a YAML rewrite on purpose. The output has to
 * stay byte-for-byte the file electron-builder would have written, sha512s and
 * all, and the surest way to keep it that way is to move the lines it wrote
 * without reformatting a single one. Everything this assumes about the shape is
 * asserted below, so a change in electron-builder's output fails the release
 * rather than shipping a manifest nobody checked.
 *
