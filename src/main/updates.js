/**
 * Finding out that a newer release exists, and installing it where that can be
 * done safely.
 *
 * Two modes, and which one is in force is not a preference. It is a question of
 * what the running copy can get verified on its behalf:
 *
 *   install  electron-updater fetches the release and hands the file to the
 *            platform's own updater, which checks its code signature against
 *            the signature of the copy already installed before replacing
 *            anything. That check is the whole basis for trusting a binary
 *            that arrived over the network.
 *   notify   the app learns a release exists and hands over a link. The
 *            download happens in the browser, where the OS still gets to have
 *            an opinion about what it just received.
 *
 * `notify` was the only mode this file had, for the reason set out in
 * `installable` below: an updater with nothing checking signatures is an
 * unauthenticated remote code execution channel into a machine that holds SSH
 * keys, which is a strange thing to build into an SSH client. That reasoning
 * has not changed. What changed is that the NSIS installer on Windows can be
 * updated through a channel that at least verifies the payload against the
 * manifest, and the mac and AppImage paths light up on their own the moment
 * the thing they need is true.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the account or the vault. A release notice that only
 * reached signed-in users with an unlocked vault would be a security fix
 * quietly withheld from the people least likely to notice it was missing.
