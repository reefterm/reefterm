/**
 * The remote toolset, served over the loopback interface.
 *
 * Claude Code takes our tools as JavaScript functions and runs them inside its
 * own SDK, in this process. Codex cannot: it connects to MCP servers by URL or
 * by spawning a command, so the tools have to be reachable from outside.
 *
 * Outside, but not far. The handlers hold live ssh sessions and the app's
 * settings, so moving them into a subprocess would mean inventing a second
 * protocol to talk back here for every call. Instead this serves them over
 * http on 127.0.0.1: the tools stay exactly where they are, and the agent gets
 * a URL.
 *
 * Three things keep that from being a hole in the side of the app:
 *
 *   - it binds to 127.0.0.1 with an OS-assigned port, so nothing off this
 *     machine can reach it and the port is not guessable from run to run
 *   - every request must carry a bearer token generated at startup, compared
 *     in constant time. Anything else gets 401 before it is parsed
 *   - it is started on demand by a provider that needs it, and stopped when
 *     the last one is done
 *
 * The approval policy is the same one the other provider uses, applied in the
 * same place it matters: before the handler runs. A call that needs a person
 * parks here until the panel answers, so "may I restart this service" reaches
 * the user whichever agent asked it.
