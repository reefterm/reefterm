 *
 * Two things are different enough from the Claude path to say out loud.
 *
 * The tools do not travel with the query. Codex reaches an MCP server by URL,
 * so `mcp-host` serves ours on loopback and this hands over the address and a
 * token. Same handlers, same approval card, same activity log.
 *
 * A turn is a call, not a stream you push into. `runStreamed` runs one turn to
 * completion and ends, where the Claude SDK keeps one iterator open for the
 * life of the conversation. So this holds the thread and starts a turn per
 * message, which is also why the model and the effort can be changed between
 * turns without anything being restarted.
