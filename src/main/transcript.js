 * A short, in-memory tail of what each session printed.

 * The assistant needs to see what the terminal saw. Three existing places hold
 * some of that and none of them will do on their own. The renderer's xterm
 * scrollback is capped and dies with a reload. The session log is off by
 * default and writes to disk, so asking it a question means reading a file the
 * user may have told us never to create. The MessagePort carries the bytes
 * past us but keeps nothing.
 *
 * So the bytes are tapped where they arrive, in the same place the session log
 * is fed, and the last stretch of them is kept in memory. Nothing is written to
 * disk and nothing outlives the session: this is a window onto a live terminal,
 * not a record of it. The session log remains the thing an audit reads.
 *
 * Escape sequences are stripped with the session log's own stripper, so a
 * screenful of colour codes does not eat the budget, and so what the assistant
 * reads is close to what a person sees.

 * The session log holds back everything from the last ESC onward, which costs
 * it nothing: it writes continuously and flushes the remainder when the
 * session closes, so the held text always lands a moment later.
 *
 * This buffer is read on demand, and the thing it is nearly always asked for
 * is the last line on screen. Holding back from the last ESC would hide
 * exactly that: a prompt ends with a colour reset, so `root@web-01:~#` would
 * sit in the pending buffer until the user typed something else. So only a
 * sequence that is genuinely still open is held:
 *
 *   ESC alone, or ESC followed by the start of a two or three byte escape
 *   CSI with no final byte yet          ESC [ 3
 *   OSC, DCS, PM or APC with no terminator yet
 *
 * Anything already terminated is passed through and stripped normally.
