 * names for a file sitting on a Linux box. On Windows all four are path
 * syntax, so joining one straight onto a download directory lets the server
 * decide where the bytes land. `..\..\evil.exe` resolves clean out of the
 * folder the user picked, and the Startup folder is a short walk from there.
 *
 * So nothing from a listing is ever joined directly. Each name is first
 * reduced to a single inert segment, and the assembled path is then checked
 * against the root it was supposed to stay under. The second half catches
 * anything the first half missed, including whatever `path.join` decides a
 * future Node version should normalise.
