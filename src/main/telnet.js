/**
 * Telnet sessions.
 *
 * The shape is ssh.js's (one session per pane, keyed by the pane id, a
 * MessagePort carrying the bytes) with everything SSH does around the bytes
 * removed, because telnet has none of it. There is no handshake to verify, no
 * host key, and no authentication this end participates in: a telnet server
 * asks for a login over the connection itself, the way it would to a physical
 * terminal, so the credentials on a telnet host record are simply never read.
 *
 * That is worth being blunt about rather than papering over. Telnet sends
 * everything, passwords included, in the clear. It is here because a console
 * server, a PDU or a switch that has never had an SSH daemon still has to be
 * reached, and reaching it from this app is better than reaching it from a
 * second one. It is not here as an alternative to SSH.
 *
 * The protocol itself is in telnet-protocol.js.
