 * Carries terminal settings in and out of the cloud snapshot.
 *
 * These live in localStorage, which the main process cannot read, so the
 * renderer is the only side that can see them change. This hook reports them
 * up whenever they do, and writes back what a pull brought down from another
 * device.
 *
 * The keys are listed here rather than each hook reporting its own, so adding a
 * setting to the snapshot is one line in one place instead of a change spread
 * across every hook that happens to persist something.
