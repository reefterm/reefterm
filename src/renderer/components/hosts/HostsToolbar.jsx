/**
 * The Hosts page's header: the four controls that change what you are looking
 * at, led by the search field.
 *
 * Nothing here describes the page. The sidebar item is already lit and the cards
 * are plainly hosts, so a title and a count of what you can see only spent the
 * widest part of the row saying what nothing contradicts. Search takes that
 * width instead. The one count that was not merely restating the view (how
 * many hosts sit outside the folder you are standing in) belongs to the path,
 * not to a header, and the breadcrumb below is where to put it if it is wanted.
 *
 * The search field carries the ref because the panel gives it focus from a
 * keystroke: it is the control people reach for first, and hunting for it with
 * the mouse is exactly what the shortcut exists to avoid.
 *
 * Narrowing by tag is inside the sort menu rather than in a row of its own. The
 * two are the same question asked twice (what am I looking at, and in what
 * order), and the row it used to have was a row of thirty chips that only
 * appeared once you had already discovered the feature it was advertising.
