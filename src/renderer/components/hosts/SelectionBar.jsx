/**
 * What you can do with the cards you have picked out.
 *
 * Floats over the list rather than sitting in the header, for two reasons: it
 * exists only while there is a selection, and a bar that appears and disappears
 * in the layout would shove the whole grid up and down as you select and
 * deselect. It is also nearer the cards it is talking about than a header would
 * be, which is where your eyes already are.
 *
 * The actions are not equals, and the row says so: filing a selection is what
 * you selected it for, so `Move` is the only filled thing here and the rest
 * carry no chrome until you touch them, which is the rule stated on `Button`'s
 * own variants. Four bordered buttons of the same weight would have left
 * nothing leading and a red outline shouting from the end of it.
 *
 * `Tag` is the one action that comes and goes: folders are not tagged, so a
 * selection of folders alone is not offered it. Showing it disabled would be
 * worse: a permanently greyed button in a bar that only exists for a moment is
 * a puzzle, not an affordance.
 *
 * It is always one row. A floating bar is sized by its contents while the panel
 * it floats in can be half its width, and both of the ways flexbox offers to
 * cope with that look broken rather than tight: shrinking breaks the text
 * mid-phrase ("3 / selected"), and wrapping strands the last button on a line
 * of its own. So the contents are made to fit instead: nothing shrinks,
 * nothing wraps, and the words stand down to their icons on a narrow window.
