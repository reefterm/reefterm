                        including the address, and the header gets the width back.

                        A desktop-only pane has no session to describe, so it
                        reads the path off the desktop instead. Same mark, same
                        place; only the source differs.

                        An IPMI-only pane gets no mark at all: its address is
                        already on the bar below, as a URL, and a second copy of
                        it here would be the only thing the mark had to say. */}
