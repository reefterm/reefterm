/**
 * One service processor's own web interface, filling one pane.
 *
 * This component is a browser chrome and nothing else. It does not know what a
 * BMC is, cannot read the page, and never sees the password: the `<webview>`
 * loads the vendor's UI directly, and the main process logs it in by driving
 * that guest page from its own side. See src/main/bmc.js.
 *
 * Two things here are less obvious than they look.
 *
 * The `<webview>` is only rendered once both the URL and the partition are
 * known, and it is keyed by the partition. Both attributes are read by the
 * element when it attaches to the document, and setting either afterwards
 * either throws or is silently ignored, so the element must be born complete.
 * Keying it means a different host gets a *new* element rather than a mutated
 * one.
 *
 * The certificate prompt is drawn in the pane rather than as a modal over the
 * window, for the reason SessionScreen gives about host keys: the pane it
 * belongs to has nothing else in it yet, so there is nothing to interrupt.
