/**
 * What the assistant is pointed at, and the menu that changes it.
 *
 * This is the panel's title as well as its most important control, so it is
 * one labelled button rather than a heading with a switcher beside it: the
 * thing you read to know which server you are talking about is the thing you
 * click to change it.
 *
 * Three ways to answer "which servers", and they are not the same shape, so
 * they are not drawn the same way:
 *
 *   Two radio rows at the top, for the two answers that are a mode rather than
 *   a list: follow the session in front, or hold every host you have saved.
 *
 *   Below them, checkboxes. The sessions that are open and the hosts that are
 *   saved, as one pool you tick through. Ticking anything is the answer, so it
 *   turns the rows above off; unticking the last one hands the panel back to
 *   the session in front.
 *
 * Saved hosts are in that list whether or not they are connected, because "work
 * on these two boxes" is a thing you want to say before either of them is open,
 * and the assistant can connect one itself. A host that already has sessions
 * open says so, and ticking it puts all of them in reach.
 *
 * Desktop-only hosts are not in it at all. Every tool the assistant has works
 * through a shell, and a host stored as `desktop.only` has none: it is an RDP
 * or VNC box, usually a Windows one with no SSH server, that opens straight
 * into a picture of a screen. Offering it would be offering a target where
 * nothing can be done. A Windows host reached over SSH is a different thing and
 * stays selectable, because there the assistant can work perfectly well.
 *
 * The rows are the tab strip's rows: the remote OS on the left and the host's
 * name beside it, one line, nothing else. That is the shape these machines
 * already have everywhere else in the app, and a picker that draws them
 * differently is a picker you have to translate. The address is the thing you
 * check when two boxes share a name, so it is a tooltip rather than a second
 * line under every row: read once, on purpose, instead of forty times on the
 * way past. A saved host with nothing open dims its icon, the way a tab does
 * before its session is up.
 *
 * The search field appears once the list is long enough to hunt through. Below
 * that it is a box that costs a row and saves nothing.

 * The field at the head of the menu.
 *
 * The app's own `SearchField`, not a copy of it: Hosts, Snippets and the
 * keychain all lead with this control and the whole point of that component is
 * that there is one of it. A hand-rolled one here had already drifted into a
 * tighter radius and a placeholder of its own colour.
 *
 * A component rather than a bare node so it can take the focus the moment the
 * menu opens. The header is only mounted then, and an effect belonging to the
 * menu's owner would have fired long before. It also drops what was typed on
 * the way out, so reopening the menu is never a filtered list with nothing on
 * screen saying why half the servers are missing.
