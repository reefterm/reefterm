/**
 * A labelled dropdown for the assistant panel.
 *
 * `ui/MenuButton` is the app's dropdown and this is not trying to replace it,
 * but its trigger is a fixed 32px icon by design and both of the menus in this
 * panel have to say a word: which host the conversation is about, and which
 * model is answering. So the trigger is a render prop here and the menu itself
 * borrows MenuButton's styling, radius and item shape, so the two never read as
 * different kinds of dropdown.
 *
 * No portal. Everything this opens over belongs to the panel, which is a plain
 * column with nothing clipping it, unlike a menu in a terminal pane header.
 *
 * Sections carry their own value and setter, which is what lets one menu hold
 * two unrelated choices: the composer's chip sets the model and the effort from
 * a single popover, the way one control that reads "Opus 5, High" ought to.
 *
 * A section may bring a control of its own instead of a list of rows, as
 * `content`. Effort is a run along one scale rather than a set of alternatives,
 * and five rows of radio buttons say the opposite: they make "low" and "max"
 * look like different things to pick rather than two ends of the same dial.
 * Such a section can also put its current value in the heading line, as
 * `aside`, since the rows that would otherwise have carried a tick are gone.
 *
 * `note` is a node under the rows, for the state a list of choices cannot show
 * on its own: that it is still being read, or that reading it failed and the
 * offer is to try again.
 *
 * A section may instead be `multi`, which turns its rows into checkboxes: it
 * carries `values`, an array, and `onToggle` rather than `onChange`, and a
 * click leaves the menu open. Picking three servers out of ten is three clicks
 * and one glance at what is ticked, not three round trips through a menu that
 * shuts itself each time.
 *
 * `header` is a block above the sections that does not scroll away, for the
 * search field a long list needs. Without one the menu is a single scroller,
 * exactly as it was.
 *
 * An option may carry a `badge`: a short string that sits beside the label
 * instead of inside it, so it survives a name long enough to be truncated. The
 * scope menu uses it to say which of four sessions on the same host a row is.
 *
 * It may also carry a `tooltip`, with `tooltipHint` dimmed beside it, for the
 * detail that would otherwise be a second line. A list of servers reads best as
 * one line each, the way the tab strip does: the name identifies it and the
 * address is what you check when you are unsure, which is a hover rather than
 * something to be read forty times on the way down the list.
 *
 * An option may also carry `onRemove`, which the history menu uses to throw a
 * conversation away. It is drawn beside the row rather than inside it, because
 * a button nested in a button is not a thing, and it only appears on hover: a
 * delete on every row of a list you are scanning is an invitation to misclick.
 *
 * A row is meant to be read, not decoded. Two lines, and the separation between
 * them comes from the title going the whole way to white rather than from the
 * description being dimmed into the background: a description at 11px has to
 * stay comfortably readable, so it cannot be the thing that gives way.
 *
 * The choice you are currently on carries a filled background as well as a
 * tick, because a tick in the corner is not an answer to "which one am I on".

 * drifted grey against a themed hover sitting right above it.
 *
 * One step, not several. It has a tick as well, so this only has to answer
 * "which one am I on" at a glance, and it has to keep doing that while the
 * pointer is resting on some other row. Its own hover is a step further up
