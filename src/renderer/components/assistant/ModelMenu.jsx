/**
 * The model and how hard it should think, as one chip in the composer.
 *
 * These two live on the settings page as well, where they are explained
 * properly. They are repeated here because they are the settings people change
 * mid-conversation, when an answer was not good enough or is taking too long,
 * and walking to a settings page to do it means losing the thread you were
 * pulling on. One control for both, because "which model, how hard" is a
 * single decision about how much this next question is worth.
 *
 * Neither list is written here, and neither has a hardcoded stand-in. `models`
 * is what the installed Claude Code reported it can run, and the effort scale
 * is narrowed to the levels the chosen model actually takes, which is not the
 * same five for all of them. Until the runtime has been asked, which it can
 * only be once it is running, the menu offers the one row that is true either
 * way: whatever Claude Code is already set to use.
 */

/**
 * What the list is doing, when it is not simply there.
 *
 * Reading a catalog means starting the agent's runtime, which takes about a
 * second and sometimes fails, and a menu with one row in it looks the same
 * either way. So it says which: still coming, or came back with nothing and
 * here is the button to ask again.
