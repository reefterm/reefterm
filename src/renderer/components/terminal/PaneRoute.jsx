/**
 * The mark in a pane header saying where this session goes, and what it goes
 * through on the way.
 *
 * It replaces the `user@host` the header used to write out, which was the same
 * string on every pane of a session and only ever half the answer: it said where
 * the session ends up and nothing about what carries it, so a connection relayed
 * through a bastion or opened through a proxy looked identical to a direct one.
 *
 * `route` is what main reported at connect time (see `describeRoute` in ssh.js),
 * so it describes the connection that exists rather than the settings, which may
 * have been edited since. It carries no wording, only structure: main records
 * what happened, this file decides how it reads.
 *
 * The hops are laid out as a column of dots joined by a hairline, so the shape of
 * a route is visible before any of it is read, and the destination is told from
 * what merely carries the connection by weight rather than by colour.
 */

/**
 * The dot for each position in the path.
 *
 * Monochrome on purpose: what each hop is is written on the row beside it, so a
 * colour per kind would be a second, redundant encoding, and a row of primaries
 * in a header this quiet reads as an alert rather than as information. The
 * destination is solid; everything that only carries the connection is not.
