/**
 * The search field at the head of a collection page.
 *
 * Hosts, Snippets and the keychain all lead with the same control, and they had
 * three copies of it that had already drifted — one was mono, which made its
 * placeholder read as a different kind of field from the other two. One copy
 * now, so that cannot happen again.
 *
 * The width lives on the wrapper: `FIELD_CLASS` carries `w-full`, which
 * Tailwind emits after the fixed widths and would win over one set on the input
 * itself. `flex-1` with a floor rather than a fixed width, so the field runs to
 * whatever controls sit on its right and yields instead of collapsing when the
 * window gets narrow.
 *
 * The ref is the input, because every page that mounts this focuses it from a
 * keystroke: it is the control people reach for first, and hunting for it with
 * the mouse is exactly what the shortcut exists to avoid.
