/**
 * One optional section of a form, folded away until it is wanted.
 *
 * The host editor grew to around twenty controls, of which four are the ones
 * anybody fills in. Laid out flat, those four read as no more important than
 * the sixteen that do not, and creating a host means scrolling past port
 * forwards and algorithm flags to find the password box.
 *
 * Two rules keep the folding honest:
 *
 *   A section that already holds something opens itself, so editing a host
 *   never buries what is set on it.
 *
 *   A closed section says what is inside it, so folding costs no information.
 *   The whole record stays readable without opening anything.
 *
 * Contents are unmounted while closed rather than hidden with CSS. That keeps
 * `reportValidity` away from fields nobody can see, which would otherwise
 * refuse to submit while being unable to show what the problem was.
