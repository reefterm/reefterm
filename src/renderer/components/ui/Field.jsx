/**
 * Form field chrome, in one place.
 *
 * The inputs across the host, key, folder and snippet forms had drifted into
 * three different heights, two radii and two focus treatments. They all read as
 * the same kind of control, so they are all styled from here.
 *
 * `rounded-xl` because that is what every full-height control in the app is:
 * `Button` and `IconButton` at `md` and `lg`, the menus, the sheet's close. A
 * field at `rounded-lg` was the odd one out, and it showed most in the sheets,
 * where a stack of them sits directly above a footer of buttons. The smaller
 * `rounded-lg` is not wrong, it is just the radius the same components use at
 * `sm`: it belongs to h-8 controls, and these are h-9 and taller.
