/**
 * The field tags are typed into.
 *
 * A plain comma-separated text box was the other option, and is what the
 * snippet editor still uses. It is worse here for one reason: a host's tags are
 * shared with every other host, and a text box gives you no way to see that
 * "staging" already exists before you type "stage" and create a second tag that
 * means the same thing. So the tags that are already in use sit under the
 * field, and picking one is a click.
 *
 * That list is a panel of its own rather than a run of chips behind the words
 * "In use:". Two rows of pills with a label wedged into the start of the first
 * one read as an overflowing field — as though the tags were somehow half
 * applied — when they are the opposite: a menu of what you have not picked. So
 * it gets a border, a heading that says which of the two things it is currently
 * showing (everything, or what matches what you are typing), and a `+` on every
 * chip, because a chip that adds and a chip that reports are otherwise the same
 * chip.
 *
 * Committing:
 *
 *   Enter, Tab, comma   take what is typed
 *   Backspace on empty  take back the last chip, into the field, so a typo is
 *                       corrected rather than retyped
 *   blur                take what is typed, because a half-entered tag left
 *                       behind on save is a tag the user believes they added
 *
 * The chips are normalised exactly as the store will normalise them, so what
 * you see here is what ends up on the record.
