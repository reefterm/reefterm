 * One Windows desktop, filling one pane.

 * main process had already authenticated by the time the component connected,
 * and noVNC drew a session that needed no credential. Here the protocol runs on
 * this side: IronRDP, compiled to WebAssembly, speaks RDP over the loopback
 * WebSocket that main opened, and performs CredSSP itself.
 *
 * Which means this component is handed a password, and it is the only one in
 * the app that is. It is held in a local for the length of a single builder
 * call and dropped: never in state, never on a ref, never in a closure that
 * outlives `connect`. A re-render cannot leak what it does not keep, and a
 * reconnect asks main for it again.

 * The difference is what changes. `fit` changes the picture — the desktop stays
 * whatever resolution it connected at and is drawn larger or smaller, so text
 * blurs as it stretches. `resize` changes the desktop, over RDP's Display
 * Control channel: Windows genuinely switches resolution, moves the taskbar and
 * reflows, and the result is sharp because nothing is being scaled at all.
