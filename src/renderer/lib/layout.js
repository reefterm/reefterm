 * adjustable one off the right, so `lg:grid-cols-3` cheerfully keeps three
 * columns in a container that has since been squeezed to the width of two, and
 * every card in it ends up eliding its own title.
 *
 * `auto-fill` with a floor of 15rem drops a column whenever the remaining ones
 * would go under about 240px, which is roughly where a hostname and an address
 * stop fitting on their lines. The `min()` is the standard guard: without it a
 * container narrower than the floor gets one column that overflows it rather
 * than one column that fits.
